# A React App for Weather Report

A weather app that checks the current weather and forecast for cities worldwide using React.

Done by using an API endpoint, which returns weather info for multiple world cities in a JSON format.

## Functionalities

- When a user writes a city name in the input field and clicks the button, the current weather below for that city is shown.

## Requirements
- Displays the city name, temperature, wind speed, and weather description for the current day.
- Show an error message if an invalid city name is provided.
- Show a loading state when the app is waiting for an API response.
- Disable the search button if the input text is empty.
- Within the JSON result, the “forecast” node is an array that contains information
about the weather for the next 3 days. Calculate and show which one of the next 3 days has the following:
■ Highest temperature
■ Lowest temperature
■ Highest wind speed
■ Lowest wind speed
- Set a city as default


## Running the application

### `npm start`
